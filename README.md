DockerDesk
===========

A tiny, solo-friendly tool to curate, lint, and visualize Docker cron-like schedules and lightweight container tasks. The goal is to incrementally grow a practical utility that helps track recurring container jobs, generate example schedules, and offer simple views for what runs and when.

Planned features:
- Parse simple YAML job specs into a readable schedule.
- Validate cron expressions and highlight next run times.
- Generate example schedules for quick starts.
- Export to Markdown for easy sharing.
- No runtime dependency on Docker; this is a planning/visualization tool.

Status: WIP; early scaffold.
